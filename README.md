This repository contains the code and documentation for a project focused on classifying cardiac conditions using logistic regression. The project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) to transform the dataset, logistic regression modeling, and evaluation of model performance based on various metrics. Three different models are considered and compared, including one implemented using the stats model for logistic regression and two using the scikit-learn library.
